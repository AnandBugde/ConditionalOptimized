The provided code utilizes the .filter() method to dynamically filter the results based on the user-input search criteria. 
The use of logical operators (&&) in the filter condition allows for flexible filtering without the need for explicit if-else statements.

If nameInput is not provided (empty), it won't filter based on name.
If ageInput is not provided (empty), it won't filter based on age.
If entityInput is not provided (empty), it won't filter based on entity.

This way, users can provide any combination of search criteria (name, age, or entity), 
and the filtering will adapt accordingly. It's a concise and flexible way to handle multiple search criteria without the need for explicit **if-else** statements.
